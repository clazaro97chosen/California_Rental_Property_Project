    "Each row represents a city in california we have a total collection of 452 cities/instances in the dataset. **Some attributes contain null values**.  In our case this means the variable was not in the text section of the housing information provided by Towncharts.com. Although the data set is fairly small by Machine Learning standards this data set is great as a first step in predicting median rental rates in california. Understandbly I will need to decide which method to use to treat these missing values later."

    "It is important to note that all attributes are numerical. No dummy variables need to be created for an ordinal character variable. If there was a categorical attribute with a large number of possible categories it is recommended to avoid the computational complexity by replaacing each category with a learnable low dimensional vector  called an embedding. For future research perhaps some character variables should be considered after seeking domain expertise about valuable character variables to consider in the prediction of median rental price. "

    "* Two attributes median housing cost for homeowners with a  mortgage (including the cost of the mortgage or other debt) and median real estate taxes paid by onwers of homes in the area have a noticable number of high values at the tail end (spike) of their distribution of values. <br><br>\n",
    "* The mean percent of all occupied housing units that are owned housing units across the cities is greater than the mean of all occupied housing units that are rental housing units mean of 57% vs mean of 42% both have a fairly normal distribution <br><br>\n",
    "* A variable that provides insight how much the property is worth(house and lot, mobile home and lot, or condominium unit) if it was for sale as a percent of the median earnings for a worker in the area this attribute has a mean of 861 standard deviation of 473, and a median of 837.

    "Best practice advises me to create a unique test set and avoid generating a different test as over time the Machine Learning algorithms will get to see the whole dataset. There are some important considerations when creating a test set. And they depend on whether I will be fetching an updated dataset on occassion or if I would be working on just one dataset. The latter has a simple solution of setting the random number generator seed in ***train_test_split()***, so that it always generates the same shuffled indices for extracting the instances to include in my test set. While the former involves using each instance's identifier to decide whether or not it should go in the test set (assuming instances have a unique and immutable identifer). This eliminates the possibility of leakage of instances previously in the training set into the new test set. However stratisfied sampling might be preffered over random sampling in the occasion that you want to ensure that the test set is representative of some attribute in your data set."

My belief is that this is a vital attribute in predicting median rental prices. For example, if my test set contained a grand majority of instances in which med_owner_cost was between the 3rd Quantile and the max of med_owner_cost, than no matter what machine learning pipeline I implemented my test error would always be large.
